A straightforward content-based movie recommendation system with a small-scale rating feature was developed to enhance user engagement. This system employs collaborative filtering to refine its recommendations, offering personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. Blending content and collaborative filtering ensures a more tailored and enjoyable cinematic experience.

This Recommendation System was created as an assignment for the IRWA (Information Retrieval & Web Analytics) module, in 3rd year 2nd semester. All the codes with their explanations are mentioned in the report.
